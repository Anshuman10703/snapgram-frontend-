Snapgram: A Serverless Social Media ApplicationA live screenshot or GIF of the running application would go here.üåü OverviewSnapgram is a modern, full-stack social media application built on a serverless architecture using Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's a proof-of-concept project designed to demonstrate the power, scalability, and cost-efficiency of building a dynamic web application entirely within the AWS Free Tier.This application allows users to register, log in, create and share photo-based posts, and manage their content. The project served as an invaluable learning experience in building robust, cloud-native applications from the ground up.‚ú® FeaturesUser Authentication: Secure user registration and login powered by Amazon Cognito.Post Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for posts, with data stored in Amazon DynamoDB.Image Uploads: Efficient and secure image uploads directly to Amazon S3 using a pre-signed URL methodology.Dynamic Feed: A responsive home page displaying a feed of all posts.Post Details: A dedicated page for viewing detailed information about a single post.Responsive UI: A clean and modern user interface built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.üöÄ Live DemoExperience the application for yourself:Deployed URL: [Your AWS Amplify Hosting URL]Example: https://main.d3tvalg0vekvct.amplifyapp.comüèõÔ∏è ArchitectureSnapgram is a serverless masterpiece, where every component is a managed AWS service.High-Level Diagramgraph TD

Key Architectural Decisions:Serverless First: All backend logic runs on AWS Lambda, eliminating server management and reducing costs.Decoupled Services: The application is a collection of independent services (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB) communicating via a well-defined API.Free Tier Adherence: The architecture was intentionally designed to stay within the AWS Free Tier, demonstrating a pay-per-use model's efficiency.Pre-signed URLs: Image uploads are handled by generating a pre-signed S3 URL from a Lambda, allowing the frontend to upload files directly to S3. This is a crucial optimization for performance and cost.üõ†Ô∏è Technology StackFrontendFramework: React.jsBuild Tool: ViteLanguage: TypeScriptStyling: Tailwind CSS & Shadcn UIState Management: React Context APIRouting: React Router DOMHTTP Client: AxiosBackendCompute: AWS Lambda (Node.js)API Gateway: Amazon API Gateway (REST API)Database: Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL)Storage: Amazon S3 (Object Storage)Authentication: Amazon Cognito (User Pools, Identity Pools)Access Control: AWS IAMüöÄ DeploymentThe entire application is deployed on AWS.Frontend: Hosted on AWS Amplify Hosting, with continuous deployment from a GitHub repository.Backend: A collection of AWS Lambda functions exposed via Amazon API Gateway.üìñ Lessons LearnedCloud-Native Debugging: Serverless debugging requires a deep understanding of service integration and logging (CloudWatch is key!).CORS Configuration: Meticulous attention to detail is required for CORS policies in both API Gateway and Lambda functions to ensure seamless cross-origin communication.Local vs. Cloud Environments: Discovered the significant benefits of a cloud-based build process (like Amplify's) for overcoming complex local development environment issues.Free Tier Design: Proactively designing the architecture to fit within Free Tier limits from the start is a rewarding and cost-effective practice.üìú LicenseThis project is open source and available under the MIT License.
